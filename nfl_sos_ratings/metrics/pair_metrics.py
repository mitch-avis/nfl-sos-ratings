"""Head-to-head pair metrics: how often one team or quarterback is rated above another.

Each row of the ``rating_pairs`` and ``qb_rating_pairs`` files compares two teams or two
quarterbacks across the same game-bootstrap resamples that give the rank ranges. Kept apart from
the team and QB definition modules, which are already long.
