"""The fixed row order of every Parquet data file the pipeline writes.

Every data file is written in one fixed row order, so two builds from the same inputs give
identical files and a rebuild's diff shows only real changes. Files read top-down keep their
published order (best first, ties broken by id); every other file is in key order: its first
identity column present, then week and game, then unit and win-probability bin for files that split
a game's plays into bins.
