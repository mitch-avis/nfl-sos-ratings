"""Points-based team ratings and head-to-head-excluded schedule strength.

A team's rating answers one question: how many points per game better than an average team was it,
after adjusting for every opponent it actually faced? It is built from expected points added
(EPA), which is already measured in points, so the pieces add up without any weighting:

- ``offense_rating``: scrimmage EPA per play the offense produced above an average offense,
  adjusted for the defenses it faced, times the league-average scrimmage plays per team-game.
- ``defense_rating``: scrimmage EPA per play the defense prevented relative to an average defense,
  adjusted for the offenses it faced, on the same per-game scale.
- ``special_teams_rating``: the same two-sided adjustment over special-teams plays (kicks, punts,
  returns, field goals, extra points), counting both the team's possession units and its coverage
  units, times the league-average special-teams plays per team-game.
- ``team_rating``: the sum of the three, in points per game on a neutral field.

Each piece comes from one simultaneous ridge fit (``nfl_sos_ratings.ridge``), so opponents are
judged against their own opponents, and so on through the whole schedule.

``sos`` is the average ``team_rating`` of the opponents a team played, one entry per game. Each
opponent is rated from a refit that leaves out every game involving the team being evaluated, so a
team beating up on an opponent cannot make that opponent look weaker in its own schedule strength.

The ridge penalties come from the previous season: ``fit_team_ratings_with_previous_penalties``
reuses the penalties cross-validation chose for the whole previous season. A few weeks of games are
too few to choose a penalty reliably (cross-validation sometimes picks the largest, rating every
team near zero), and the previous season's choice predicted early-season games better without
costing anything later. The first play-by-play season cross-validates its own.

The rating history (``fit_team_ratings_by_week``) refits the ratings on the games through each
week with the season's penalties, so each week's row shows the rating as the evidence then
supported it.
