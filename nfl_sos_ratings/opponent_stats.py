"""Head-to-head-excluded opponent profiles: what a team's opponents did against everyone else.

For each team, every unique opponent is profiled from its per-game averages in games that did
not involve that team, and the opponent profiles are averaged with equal weight per opponent. A
division rival played twice is profiled once, because removing both head-to-head games makes the
two profiles identical. The averaged profile is descriptive context for the analyst UI; the
published ratings come from the simultaneous solve in ``team_rating``.
