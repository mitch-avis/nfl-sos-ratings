"""Preseason prior for the team fit: last season's scrimmage effects, carried over and faded out.

Early in a season the team fit's ridge penalty pulls every scrimmage effect toward zero, an average
team, because a few games say little. With a prior, it pulls each team's offense and defense
toward a mean built from the previous season instead (``ridge.UnitPrior``):

    raw_o[t] = fade(g_t, horizon) * rho_o * o_prev[t]        (defense likewise)
    fade(g)  = max(0, 1 - g / horizon)
    m_o[t]   = raw_o[t] - the mean of raw_o over the teams in the fit

``o_prev`` is the team's per-play scrimmage offense effect in the previous season's published fit,
``rho_o`` the carryover slope (season t's near-unpenalized effects regressed on season t-1's
published ones, through the origin, pooled over the season pairs before the season rated), and
``g_t`` the games the team has played. Once a team has played ``horizon`` games its prior is gone,
and centering keeps the effects averaging zero when byes leave teams with different game counts.
Special teams keep a prior of zero.

The published team fit uses the prior at ``PRIOR_HORIZON_GAMES``, the horizon the pre-registered
``check-team-prior`` test recommended: every fit of a season's games so far takes the means of
:func:`snapshot_prior`, and a head-to-head-excluded refit takes the means of the previous season
refit without the evaluated team (:meth:`PriorHistory.season_prior_without`).
